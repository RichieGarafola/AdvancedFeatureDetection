# AdvancedFeatureDetection
This project uses OpenCV to detect a reference marker image within a set of scene images using local keypoint descriptors such as SIFT, ORB, and AKAZE. It applies feature detection and brute-force matching to identify whether the marker is present and classifies each scene accordingly.
